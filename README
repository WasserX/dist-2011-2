A distributed (simplified) Make implementation for the Distributed Systems Course 2011/2
Doesn't depend on NFS, process communication using MPI.

Prerequisites:
1. OpenMPI and libraries for compiling. In ubuntu:
	sudo apt-get install openmpi-dev openmpi-bin

2. If you are using RedHat/ archlinux or any other distro that has an ls with more columns than ubuntu, change TARGET in makefile to REDHAT

Instructions:
execute 'mpirun -np <n> distMake' in the folder where the Makefile is (filename is fixed)
where n>2 is the number of process that will be created (one is needed to control the others)

Switches:
-DDEBUG --> Shows debug messages
-DCOUNT_MESSAGES --> Prints the total quantity of messages sent by the Master to the slaves
-DCOUNT_FILE_MESSAGES --> Prints the total quantity of files that the Master had to send to the slaves
-DNO_HEURISTICS --> The next node to be sent is the first ready in line. Doesn't consider which is the best to send
